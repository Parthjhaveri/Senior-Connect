# Senior Connect
A service-exchange App that connects Seniors in the community to individuals for an exchange of services. Youngsters volunteer to help Senior Citizens with any services they may need (helping them with Groceries, running errands, handy-work etc.). In exchange, Seniors can volunteer to pay it forward. Built using Access Code Generator! This is a scaffolding built using Node, Express, React, and Sequelize.

## Database Setup

## Start
First: `npm install`
To start: `npm start`

## Testing
You can add new tests in the `test` folder.

To test: `npm testttttttttttttttttttttttttttt`

Your tests are also automatically called as part of `npm start`

## Authentication
Authentication (aka login) is mostly setup, but still missing a couple key parts: a `login` and `auth` route in your API. You will need to create them in order for login to fully work.

You can see AJAX calls for these routes in the `Login.jsx` and `App.jsx` components
